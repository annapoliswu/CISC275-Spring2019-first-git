In your play directory, create four files. Make is so that: one is
untracked; one is modified; one is staged; one is in the repo. Verify
the state of your four files and ask another person to confirm you have
those four files in four states.

In this space, type the sequence of commands you used to achieve the final
state of all four files:

cd into folder
git init
git commit -m “init commit”
created a repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/annapoliswu/gitSetup.git 
In repo
	git add Main.java
	git commit -m “added Main.java”
	git push origin master
Untracked
	added plant.jpg file to directory/folder
	did not git add
Staged
	git add 03.txt
	edited 03.txt and saved
	git add 03.txt
Modified
	git add Cat.java
	edited Cat.java and saved
	did not git add
